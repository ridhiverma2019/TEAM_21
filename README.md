# Hyperparameter-Free Optimization for Probabilistic Models

## Overview
____________________________________________________________________________________________________
This project explores a hyperparameter-free optimization approach for probabilistic models by leveraging a hybrid technique that integrates Reinforcement Learning (RL), Bayesian Optimization (BO), and Gaussian Mixture Models (GMM). The goal is to create an efficient, adaptive framework that eliminates manual hyperparameter tuning while optimizing complex models in dynamic environments.

## Key Features
______________________________________________________________________________________________________

* Hybrid Approach: Combines RL, BO, and GMM for an adaptive learning process.

* Automated Hyperparameter Selection: Reduces human intervention in parameter tuning.

* Probabilistic Model Optimization: Enhances decision-making with uncertainty estimation.

* Efficient Exploration-Exploitation Tradeoff: Achieves balance using Bayesian strategies.

* Scalable and Robust: Can be extended to various machine learning tasks.

## Methodology
______________

### 1. Reinforcement Learning (RL)

* RL is used to optimize decision-making over sequential tasks by learning policies that maximize long-term rewards. The model interacts with an environment, adjusting parameters dynamically.

### 2. Bayesian Optimization (BO)

* BO provides a probabilistic approach to finding optimal hyperparameters efficiently. It uses a surrogate model (e.g., Gaussian Process) to predict performance and guide the search process.

### 3. Gaussian Mixture Model (GMM)

* GMM is employed for density estimation and clustering, allowing the system to model complex distributions and refine optimization processes.

## Implementation
__________________________________________________________________________________________

* Data Processing: Preprocesses input datasets for probabilistic modeling.

* Model Initialization: Defines the RL agent, BO framework, and GMM components.

* Training Loop: RL agent interacts with BO, and GMM refines optimization steps.

* Evaluation: Performance is measured on benchmark tasks.
